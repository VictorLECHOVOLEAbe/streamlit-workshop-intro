## #Workshop requirements
### Github account
- Create a github account in case you don't own one already.(https://github.com/)
- The account will be used when we will log in on the streamlit.io to create a python web app.
- On the github account will create a repository that will be linked to the streamlit web application.
- Will develop the entire code solution on VsCode, commit changes to github repository that will update the app automatically from the main branch.

### Snowflake account:
- Snowflake is the best thing I could learn in the last year.
- Snowflake is a Datacloud platform. It's architecture is unique and there's is huge demand on the industry of using it, fyi - clients are migrating their on premise solutions to Snowflake, while others are starting directly using it.
- We will use snowflake to ingest and query our data.
- Create a new trial account available for 120 days from the link below:
